# Planning stage
### Target Audiences:
* The audiences for this is for retro gamers. Or gamers in gerneral. A place with a small collection of games from our past.
* 

## User Experience
* I want the games to be simple and from our past. I started with Rock,Paper Sissors but decided to change it to the Rock,Paper,Sissors Lizard Spock too add alittle bit of difficulty to one of our most basic games that we played as children.
## Site Aims:
* I wanted to learn JavaScript and probably the most engaging way is through games and the best way for programs to be responive is through games.

## How Is This Will Be Achieved:
* By using JavaScript ,Html and CSS

## Wireframes
To organize my thoughts and prevent scope creep, I created wireframes for this project. Below are links to each of the mobile and desktop versions.

# What's on the table?
The header element stays on the top of the page. It contains the navigation links in a hamburger menu as it seems to be industry standard now and provide a more pleasant UX and adheres to popular conventions better.

The navigation will be in the header, and the header will be on all pages were the user can navigate to different games or home.

**The header element** 
Using it for navigation to index page and a hamburger menu to link to other pages 

**The navigation** 
Using a hamburger menu 
**The Game Library theme** 
Used a powerpoint light image as it looks nice and modern
**The information** 
The information is the rules for the games. Some are self explanatory
**The Games** 

##  1. Rock Paper Scissors
It is a simple JS game that checks for win, loss or draw against computer choice. It uses basic if/else and forEach condtions with simple HTML and CSS.

it uses following js basic methods:

 - getElementById
 - addEventListener
 - forEach
 - querySelectorAll
 - Math.random()
 - innerHTML
 - event.target. id
 - Math.floor()


##   2. Whac-a-mole
In this game we have build a grid that randomly display the mole that we have to click on to get points in our defined time period.

it uses following js basic methods:

 - querySelectorAll
 - querySelector
 - Math.random()
 - Math.floor()
 -  forEach
 - addEventListener
 - TextContent
 - Alert
 - id
 - setInterval()
 - clearInterval()



##  3. Breakout
In this game we have build a 2D breakout in which you have to break all the blocks  infront of you.
